            <h2>Who I am</h2>
            <p>I am an Atlanta-born design consultant who specializes in bridging the gap between business, design, and technology.
                I believe in the power of communication and its ability to unlock the potential that exists in any system. My passion
                for elevating products is only matched by my passion for learning.
            </p>
            <p>I am a graduate of Savannah College of Art and Design (SCAD) who achieved a Bachelor's Degree in User Experience. Afterwards I worked at a digital marketing company
                where I've had the pleasure to work with university clients such as Georgia Tech, Clemson University, and Stetson to empower their fundraising and marketing initiatives through
                design, development, and accessibility. </p>

            <h2>My Vision</h2>
            <p>I believe in the power and innovation that comes from small businesses and local initiatives. Through groundedness and connection with communities we can recognize the opportunities that exist in the world around us. I cherish these connections and choose to empower them through thoughtful action and design.</p>

            <h2>My Approach</h2>
            <p>I have and will continue to approach every situation with curiosity and humility. To ennact effective change, one has to first understand what it is that they are changing and how it exists in a greater ecosystem. Approaching carefully and with honest intention, we can find ways to manifest solutions that can fill the gaps that will support and evolve the network of connections that are already there.</p>
